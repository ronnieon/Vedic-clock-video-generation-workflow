Page 0001: KRISHNA VERSUS KALIYA: THE TOXIC DOMINION

Page 0002: In the heart of beautiful Vrindavan, a poison bloomed. Where the sacred Yamuna river bent, the water turned to black, bubbling sludge. The air itself burned, and any bird that flew across fell from the sky. This was the domain of Kaliya, the exiled serpent king. But on the branch of a tall Kadamba tree overlooking the blight, a young boy with skin like a rain cloud tightened his sash. "You’ve squatted in My river long enough, Uncle," Krishna said with a smirk, slapping his bicep with a sound like thunder. "Time to wake up."

Page 0003: With the grace of a striking falcon, Krishna leaped from the tree. He became a golden meteor, his yellow garments trailing like a comet's tail as he plunged into the toxic water. The impact was colossal. A crater of steam and poisoned spray erupted, flooding the scorched banks for a hundred bow-lengths. The river itself seemed to scream from the force of his arrival.

Page 0004: From the murky depths, a nightmare arose. One hundred and one massive serpent heads, scaled in obsidian and crowned with glowing gems, burst from the surface. Eyes burning with toxic fire fixed on the small boy standing calmly in the water. "A CHILD?" the heads hissed as one, the voice a chorus of rage and disbelief. "YOU SEEK DEATH SO EAGERLY?" Kaliya, the Naga-Raja, had awoken.

Page 0005: Before Krishna could answer, Kaliya struck. The great serpent lunged, wrapping the boy in the crushing grip of his coils. The Bhogi-Bandhan, the serpent-trap, tightened, strong enough to shatter mountains. On the shore, the people of Vrindavan cried out in terror. But within the prison of scales, Krishna was unbothered. This hug is a bit tight, he thought to himself. I should stop playing dead.

Page 0006: A brilliant light began to pulse from within Kaliya's grip. It grew from a soft hum to an incandescent blaze. With a mighty groan, Krishna expanded his divine form. The serpent's coils, which had held him fast, stretched and strained until they burst apart with a deafening crack. "GAAH! WHAT ARE YOU?!" Kaliya roared, his body recoiling in pain and shock as Krishna floated effortlessly above the churning water.

Page 0007: Enraged, Kaliya attacked with renewed fury. A hundred heads struck as one, a forest of fangs lunging from every direction. But Krishna was a blur of golden light, weaving between the snapping jaws, using one head as a springboard to dodge another, his laughter echoing over the churning water.

Page 0008: Frustrated by the boy's impossible speed, Kaliya unleashed his deadliest weapon. All one hundred heads reared back and exhaled a combined torrent of Halahala Breath, a river of venomous fire that boiled the very water it touched. "Nowhere to run, child!" he roared.

Page 0009: With a laugh, Krishna leaped high into the air, soaring over the inferno. With impossible grace, he landed not in the water, but on Kaliya's main, central hood. He struck the ancient posture of the cosmic dancer, Nataraja, and stomped his foot. A divine shockwave pulsed through the serpent's entire body.

Page 0010: The Tandava began. As each of Kaliya's other heads rose to strike, Krishna's feet met it with a rhythmic, crushing stomp. He danced from head to head, a whirlwind of gold and indigo, his feet stamping out the serpent's pride with every perfect step. "You have many heads, Kaliya," Krishna's voice called out. "Do they all know how to bow?"

Page 0011: One by one, Kaliya's heads were beaten, bloodied, and forced down. The great serpent, vomiting blood and poison, began to sink under the impossible weight of the small boy on his head. "You wanted to be King of the River," Krishna's voice echoed, calm amidst the fury. "Can you bear the weight of the Universe?"

Page 0012: Just as Kaliya's life was about to be extinguished, beautiful, serpent-like women with glowing golden forms emerged from the depths, their hands pressed together in prayer. They were the Nagapatnis, Kaliya's wives. "O Lord! The punishment is just! His sins are vast!" cried their leader. "But anger does not suit the Supreme Person! Please, show him your mercy!" Krishna’s dance softened, and he looked upon them with compassion.

Page 0013: Krishna’s dance stopped. He stepped lightly off Kaliya's head. The serpent, humbled and terrified, pleaded, "If I leave, the great eagle Garuda will surely eat me!" Krishna smiled gently and pointed to Kaliya's hood. There, shining with divine light, were the prints of Krishna's small feet. "Fear not," Krishna said. "You have been marked by God. Garuda will not harm you now." And so, the poison left the veins of the river, as Kaliya and his family departed in peace.
